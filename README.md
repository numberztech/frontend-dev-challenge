numberz Frontend Dev Challenge
===========
Greetings, tinkerer!

Thank you for your interest in joining numberz! We believe our assessment process should evaluate the skills you would use on a regular day at work. For that reason, we've included this coding challenge as part of the process.

We appreciate that this may involve a considerable investment of your time & effort, but weâ€™re hopeful it will ultimately be worthwhile for both you and us.

Thanks again, and all the best!  
The numberz team

Overview
-----------
The challenge has been kept open-ended to give you some room to exercise your creativity both in terms of _what_ you create & _how_ you build it.

The good folks at [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) have done a great job of cataloging a lot of data associated with the Star Wars universe into a simple REST API. You can find the docs to the API [here](https://swapi.co/documentation).

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to come up with a frontend that uses the above API & presents the data in a way that enables a specific use-case. You can choose any subset of the available data that's relevant to the intended purpose of your solution and make it available to the user in a meaningful way.

Submission
-------------
Once done, please drop us an email on tech-jobs@numberz.in with a Github link to your submission. Do include your contact details & resume in the email, and we will get in touch once we've evaluated the submission.

Ground Rules
----------------
* The submission should use React along with some sort of state management layer (Redux, Recompose, etc.)

Evaluation Criteria
---------------------
* Proficiency on our frontend stack - primarily React, but we also use Redux, Recompose, Apollo, etc.
* Code hygiene factors such as modularity, readability, reusability, etc.
* An eye for good UX decisions (always keep a use case & user persona in mind for whatever you build)
* Approach towards testing your code
